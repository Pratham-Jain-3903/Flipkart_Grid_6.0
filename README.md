## üèÜ Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Scalability**
   - **Challenge**: Our system needed to handle a wide range of product categories and locations, especially during peak times, with minimal hardware upgrades. Given Flipkart‚Äôs large operational scale, the solution also had to be easily deployable and adaptable across different warehouse setups.
   - **Solution**: We designed a scalable hybrid cloud-edge model that efficiently supports high traffic volumes. By deploying quantized, fine-tuned Qwen-VL models on low-cost edge devices (e.g., Jetson Nano), the system can handle real-time inferences at the warehouse level, reducing reliance on central servers. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and optimizes resource allocation, ensuring each warehouse can operate independently with minimal intervention from centralized cloud services. Additionally, the cloud component is designed to handle long-term storage, analytics, and model updates, seamlessly syncing with edge devices and keeping infrastructure upgrades to a minimum.

### 2. **Usability**
   - **Challenge**: Warehouse staff may have limited technical training, so the system needed to be highly intuitive, user-friendly, and reliable, requiring minimal interaction while handling complex tasks.
   - **Solution**: We developed a one-click interface with a dark-themed UI for easy readability and real-time response. The interface allows staff to switch between automatic and manual modes instantly, view order details, and monitor the status of each item in real-time. Additionally, we incorporated real-time user alerts that flag any incorrect, missing, extra, or expired products, enabling staff to make quick corrections. This simplified UI design ensures that minimal training is required, allowing staff to focus on operational efficiency without being distracted by complex system interactions.

### 3. **Infrastructure Efficiency**
   - **Challenge**: Given Flipkart‚Äôs diverse infrastructure, the system needed to optimize existing resources without requiring extensive additional investment.
   - **Solution**: Our hybrid model leverages both edge and cloud resources to maximize efficiency. By performing real-time inferencing on edge devices, we reduce the load on central servers, which in turn lowers idle server time and operational costs. A TCP connection ensures smooth data transfer between the edge and cloud, allowing for seamless data logging and analysis while keeping network usage optimized. Furthermore, our cloud-based logging system supports centralized monitoring and reporting, helping to streamline operations and reduce waste from unnecessary compute cycles. This approach minimizes the need for frequent upgrades and better utilizes the available resources across Flipkart's distributed network.
